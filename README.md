# Car_price_prediction_unmessenger

### Task 1: Data Preprocessing:
#### Assignment-6
Discuss the steps involved in cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, such as handling
missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.

### Task 2: Feature Selection and Engineering:
Explain the process of selecting relevant features for the prediction task.
Describe any additional feature engineering techniques employed to improve the model's
performance.
### Task 3: Algorithms:
Introduce at least two machine learning algorithms used for car price prediction (e.g.,
Bayesian Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
Provide a brief explanation of each algorithm and its suitability for the task.
Discuss any hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation techniques used for optimizing the
models.
### Task 4: Training, Evaluation & Selection:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the two algorithms on the training set and evaluate their performance using appropriate
metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared, etc.).
Compare and analyze the results of both algorithms to identify the better-performing model.
